<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LDPE Decking Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Capped composite</li><li>Uncapped composite</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LDPE decking market primarily features two types: capped composite and uncapped composite. Capped composite decking has a protective outer layer made of a durable polymer that enhances resistance to moisture, stains, and fading, making it ideal for high-traffic and harsh weather areas. Uncapped composite, on the other hand, lacks this protective layer, making it more affordable but less resistant to environmental elements, which may lead to quicker deterioration over time. Both options cater to varying customer needs and budgets in outdoor decking solutions.</p></p>
