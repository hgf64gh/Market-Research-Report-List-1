<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Engineering Machinery Tire Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bias Tire</li><li>Radial Tire</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The engineering machinery tire market primarily consists of two types: bias tires and radial tires. Bias tires have layers of fabric plies running diagonally, offering good flexibility but generally providing less strength and durability. They are cost-effective for lighter machinery. In contrast, radial tires feature plies that run perpendicular to the tread, enhancing stability, load capacity, and longevity. They are preferred for heavy-duty equipment due to their superior performance, making them ideal for rigorous construction and mining applications.</p></p>
