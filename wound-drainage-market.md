<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Drainage Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The wound drainage market primarily consists of two types: passive drains and active drains. Passive drains utilize gravity to facilitate drainage, allowing fluid to flow out of the wound without additional suction; they are typically simpler and less costly. Active drains, on the other hand, employ suction mechanisms to enhance fluid removal, offering more controlled drainage and often leading to faster healing. Both types are essential in managing post-surgical wounds, reducing complications, and improving patient recovery outcomes.</p></p>
