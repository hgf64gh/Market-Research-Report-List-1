<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lacrimal Stents and Intubation Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Monocanalicular Stents</li><li>Bicanalicular Stents</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lacrimal stents and intubation systems are medical devices used to treat lacrimal duct obstructions. Monocanalicular stents consist of a single silicone tube inserted through one canaliculus, aiding in drainage and erosion prevention. They are less invasive and simpler to place. Bicanalicular stents involve dual tubes inserted through both canaliculi, providing more extensive drainage support and stability. Both stent types enhance tear flow, reduce inflammation, and promote healing, catering to different clinical needs in ophthalmology and oculoplastic procedures.</p></p>
