<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Airport Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Towbars</li><li>Towbarless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The airport tugs market comprises two main types: conventional towbars and towbarless tugs. Conventional towbars connect the tug to the aircraft via a fixed apparatus, providing a reliable but somewhat less maneuverable solution. Towbarless tugs, on the other hand, utilize a more advanced mechanism that allows for direct coupling to the aircraft's nose wheel, offering superior maneuverability and operational efficiency. Both types serve essential roles in ground handling, with their choice dependent on specific airport requirements and aircraft types.</p></p>
