<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wound Drainage Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Passive Drains</li><li>Active Drains</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Wound drainage devices are categorized into passive and active drains. Passive drains rely on gravity and natural body processes to facilitate fluid drainage, often utilizing a simple tube system without vacuum assistance. In contrast, active drains employ suction to remove fluids more effectively, operation through negative pressure systems that actively draw out excess fluids from the wound site. Both types are essential in preventing complications, promoting healing, and managing fluid accumulation post-surgery. Their market dynamics are influenced by clinical requirements, technology advancements, and patient outcomes.</p></p>
