<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Textile Antistatic Agent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Anion</li><li>Cation</li><li>Zwitterion</li><li>Nonionic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The textile antistatic agent market is categorized into four main types: anionic, cationic, zwitterionic, and nonionic agents. Anionic agents carry a negative charge and are effective in various fabrics, promoting conductivity. Cationic agents, with a positive charge, are commonly used in textiles for their compatibility with negatively charged fibers. Zwitterionic agents possess both positive and negative charges, offering versatile properties that enhance performance. Nonionic agents, lacking any charge, provide antistatic benefits and are less likely to cause fabric discoloration.</p></p>
