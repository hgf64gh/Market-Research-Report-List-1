<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Aluminum Wheels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting Process</li><li>Forging Process</li><li>Semi - Solid Die Forging Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle aluminum wheels market consists of three primary manufacturing types: casting, forging, and semi-solid die forging. Casting involves pouring molten aluminum into molds to form wheels, offering design flexibility but lower strength. Forging, on the other hand, shapes aluminum under high pressure, resulting in stronger and lighter wheels ideal for performance applications. Semi-solid die forging combines aspects of both processes, providing enhanced strength and weight efficiency, making it a growing choice for manufacturers seeking durability and performance in their wheel designs.</p></p>
