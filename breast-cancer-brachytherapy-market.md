<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Breast Cancer Brachytherapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High-Dose Rate</li><li>Low-Dose Rate</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The breast cancer brachytherapy market is primarily divided into two types: High-Dose Rate (HDR) and Low-Dose Rate (LDR) brachytherapy. HDR involves the temporary placement of radioactive sources that deliver a high dose of radiation in a short time, typically used for accelerated partial breast irradiation. In contrast, LDR uses smaller doses of radiation delivered continuously over a longer period, often applied in a series of treatments. Both methods aim to minimize exposure to surrounding healthy tissue while effectively targeting cancer cells.</p></p>
