<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Intelligent Industrial Pump Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal</li><li>Positive Displacement</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Intelligent Industrial Pump Market is primarily segmented into two types: centrifugal and positive displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps utilize rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for high flow rates and low-viscosity liquids. They are widely used in water supply and chemical processing. In contrast, positive displacement pumps move fluid by trapping a fixed amount and forcing it through the outlet, offering better performance with viscous fluids and providing higher pressure at lower flow rates, making them suitable for applications like lubrication and metering.</p></p>
