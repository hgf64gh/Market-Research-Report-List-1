<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Digital Positioner Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Positioner</li><li>Double Acting Positioner</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The digital positioner market is primarily divided into two types: single acting and double acting positioners. Single acting positioners utilize a spring mechanism to return the actuator to a default position when no signal is present, making them suitable for applications where only one direction of movement is required. In contrast, double acting positioners provide more control, applying pressure in both directions to accurately position the actuator. This makes them ideal for applications requiring precise control and fast response times in various industrial processes.</p></p>
